# Perlotto - minimal google music / youtube wrapper wrapper

![Screenshot](./perlotto.png)

Perlotto is a minimal wrapper around Google Music and Youtube services
that turnes them into real platers but does not add tons of crap on top.
So, what's inside?

* Google music and Youtube support
* Multimedia keys
* Last.FM scrobbling
* No notifications

That's it.
